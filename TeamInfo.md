## Project Summary

Our system aims to manage hotel services at both customer’s level and the hotel ownership’s level. For customer level, our system allows customers to register in the system to book reservations for the hotel. Also, we will introduce a membership program for subscribed users to get discounts for different room types. For reservations, our system will ask the customers from basic descriptions of the check in/out dates and the number of travelers to specific room service requests. Also, we provide a special shuttle bus/chauffeur management system for customers to book bus seats or private sedans for airport pickup or sightseeing.

As for hotel ownership’s level, we would receive the specific requests from the user reservations and shuttle bus bookings. With this data confirmed by the reservations, we can apply scheduling algorithms for the hotel to assign the number of cleaning ladies, bus drivers, and other employees to work on specific dates. In sum, we propose to merge these two levels in a single system for hotels to manage more effectively.
